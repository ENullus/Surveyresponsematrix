cuts to medicaid
Threatened cuts to Medicaid Medicare Social Security SNAP & everything DOGE/ musk do, migrants kidnapped & denied due process
The craziness going on in Washington, the eroding of our Constitution, the erosion of our democracy, losing our position in the world especially against our allies.
The thought of losing Medicare, Medicaid or SSDI. I worked a good long career career, helping children and their families through life’s most challenging times. Now my life is challenging, as my body has succumbed to the long term effects of an inherited connective tissue disorder, that has left my joints loose and minimal, and my muscles weak. I rely on the assistance I earned.
Healthcare and finances
Cuts to programs that seniors need to survive
Social Security, Medicare,tax giveaway, Medicaid
Unfair and unconstitutional immigration, feckless economic policies, unconstitutional pressure being placed on business, educational institutions, and members of government, the existence of Doge, headed by musk and it’s thoughtless slash and burn activities; based on his Grandfathers agenda in the 1930s. This is an assault on our democracy to usher in an authoritarian anti democracy regime
Social security, Medicaid, illegal detention
our rights, the constitution
The end of our democracy.
Losing democracy
The economy, budget cuts to our education system, book bans, removal of funding for science, museums, libraries and more, drop in my 401k, the safety and preservation of our national parks, the rejection of climate change and policies to reduce the damage being done by our systems, women's rights and the fear I'm going to be placed in a red bonnet....

The government and its structures being decimated: the closing the the Dept of Ed, the National Parks potentially being sold off or drilled, weakening environmental regulations, the wealth gap, healthcare systems being gutted, social security going away, the loss of the CPB, increased logging, the HHS being rendered useless with RFK Jr at the helm, loss of rights for women, people being disappeared, general hatred on the rise, violence against minority groups, the dismantling of systems designed to give people a fair chance - DEIA, school lunch, head start - honestly there’s NOTHING that has happened that I’m happy about and Mike Lawler keeps delivering messages from Washington with a smile on his face and he’s “so proud” of all they’ve accomplished so far. He clearly believes his actions have no consequences and is acting as though no matter how he votes he’ll be safe - what has he been promised??
Cuts to programs , rising prices

Health concerns
yFor the elderly and disability people
Heat waves effects everyone
Yes and we all are human
cause global warming
I think you should have water stations around key points to the city for New York is so they can get free water so they can hydrate and don't pass out for the elderly
because it's starting to get really dangerously hot inexpectedly

Heat stroke. Greatly dimindhes productivity. Exacerbates some illnesses
Ye elderly people need some place to go to be safe.
Because, heat makes people ill
cause the heat is dangerous
because not everyone has access to air conditioning spaces and or money to afford it
yes. we need protection.
Yes. I got robbed after a heat stroke
because it’s hot
Yes for the elderly and people with respiratory problems!
Heat affects everyone, especially outdoor workers
Yes. Many people don’t have the means
Yes. It's hot
Duh
Yes cause this heat is killer

No their are enough stores with Air Conditioning
Yes ... poverty
Yes absolutely
yes older people need for health
Yes heat exhaustion is a real medical emergency
Because we need cooling also
it's gonna get worse
yes especially for the senior citizens and the babies
absolutely, to save lives
Yes, because some older citizens may not survive this heat.
Yess , too many home less people in the streets.
Yes. Heat is extremely dangerous and can deadly.
Yes bc it puts lives in danger
Because sometimes is hard to afford it.
Yes because of the elderly an disabled
Ok
Yes because of the amount of power we use on the electricity grid.
yes because I'm dying out here
yes of course
Record heat
City is crumbling due to this specific heating
Yes, for the most vulnerable, seniors, kids and the homeless and the ones financially struggling like me.
yes
Yes because a lot of broke people are invisible by the rest and its disheartening.
Vdcvvv
Yes. Climate change is real and we need public health education about electrolytes and other safety support
Yes. For the elderly
I think they have to make it more aware there are these services.
Their what? The mayor? Yes, ge should realize thay not all classrooms in NYC have air conditioning that worked. Thte plan was to add units to all rooms, but then the pandemic happened. He should check in with principals about this and offer to pay for air conditioning for classrooms without it.
Yes
Yea
Global warming, the end of Earth
Yes , because climate change is here and we really need to care about the people and future for our children. We need to all change to renewable energy. It’ll stop from so many heat waves
the old pi
do to we have senior or disable people that can't travel to cooling plce
Because there’s a lot traffic and people .
Absolutely as more people die from heat than any other weather related catastrophe.
Triple digit heat can become dangerous quickly.
Its becoming more common. And landlords are mot required to offer AC
each summer is warmer
we are all using up all the power together all at the same time. We must be ready for anything especially a blackout, now that all air conditioners will be on.
many of us can't afford air conditioner
because heat stroke is a problem for people living in sublets with slumlords and neighbors shame could kill someone…
too many homeless people are suffering from the heat and too many old people
it's getting worse every year global warming is not going away
because excessive heat can have negative health consequences
Ndnjhb
We can die
because we are in need.
We’re absolutely living the consequences
Because every year it’s get Worse it should be a factor,heat is a killer !!
because we have a lot of elderly
So much concrete. Vents. And the unhoused folks suffer most.
just in case their is a brown ir blackout.
more focus is needed due to hotter summers
is too hot
it’s dangerous and a silent killer.
because so many people are sensitive to high heat
cause last year my friend sufferd a heat stroke so that is very dangerous especially for baby’s children and older people
should because you families with no A/C and cant afford them neither
There’s a lot of elderly people who don’t have access to get around
should use aporopiate culling materail for cobtruction
New York City breaking a heat record every year is just a disastrous thing
Heat strokes and just the unbearable heat
because so many people are losing resources and access to shelter, let alone a climate controlled space.
Global warming
there are many unhoused people who have no where to go which can contribute to deaths in NYC
NYC gets extremely hot in the summer
Because of the economy a lot of people can not afford a/c and also the elderly
the heat is dangerously hot
Seniors should have access to keeping cool Health disparities

To protect our environment and safety! 💗
stay safe. you cannot be replaced, but things can be
It's complex, we need to build in place that are more better to handle extreme conditions. And fireproof building outside and inside. Start with one building at a Time. Start at the places that we know are hot zones. large places where people can go to escape the immediate fire, more study needs to be done on the flooding conditions I believe the concrete construction is ideal for housing including the roofing is possible can handle extreme conditions and can be easier to repair after an extreme weather conditions. To save lives and reduce cost in the long term. Thank you for having this space to communicate with one another !

climate
As a gardener, each growing season is different this season we had drought. If we do receive rain in front of a huge storm, then it floods. I’m not a specialist for the weather, but we all do see a major shift in this weather we have to fix or figure out what is causing this before it’s too late. I have never seen the devastation that occurred in Florida back to back hurricanes.

its needed
Cleaner environment and the climate change
I don’t know
it would lower energy costs so that money could go to better things for the schools
kids can't pay attention if they are cold
I’m fo keping children safe
it could not hurt
it would teach them how to respect the Earth in a much better form
hopefully improve them
not sure
Solar panels on roofs and parking areas could provide clean power
Healthier for our children and great for our planet
By giving students , safer learning environments, they are able to flourish.
Renewable energy doesn’t add to remissions that are destroying a livable climate.
better safer cleaner energy and save fossil fuels
in a positive way
yes

Keep them healthy and safe
Clean energy will impact everyone
make a better and brighter future for our children
Crucial that we work for clean energy & climate restoration
I have Relatives in Sarasota 😐🌊
great
yes
Intelligent solutions impact ALL of us❣️
It's just necessary for humanity!!!!!!!
well it certainly will keep down costs we're all tired of the tax increases.
Probably raise costs and not too reliable !!!
Clean air is imperitive for a healthy body and mind. Need I say more?
decrease cost of electricity, i.prove learning environment for students
In a very positive way. Only the best for our children.
cleaner air for our children to breath
solar energy saves money
Healthier to breath
If you consider electric vehicles clean energy then I disagree with you and believe schools will be impacted because the direction we are going in is ked by ruthless greedy people, however if we went with the clean energy provided by nature, children could have a bright future. We are at a crossroads.
In the long run save money. And save the planet
Build resilinece
Hopefully clean energy would support students and having safe and healthy environments to learn in!
If clean energy means microgrid or some way to increase the resiliency of power at the school it would be valuable beyond the school itself
it would make our schools cleaner and more efficient!
I feel like they could be a source of education for kids, a revenue source for utilizing roof space, and a way of future proofing our buildings and reducing operating costs.
It would help out a lot.
by saving money in the long run and setting an example for businesses and other institutions
Better use of tax dollars
Help students have healthier lives!
Positively
Clean energy, if done through the lens of completely equity and fairness, would free up room in the local school budgets to be reallocated to potentially, maybe better salaries for educators.
Reduce energy cost burdens. Be a teaching tool fornext gen worlers.
Clean energy would be a push in the right direction for sustainability. It would make the environment better too, benefitting the moods and efficiency of the students. It will also create jobs and help to assist and award those who help make our country greener, for current and future generations!
Air conditioning is imperative in the recent wave of increased temperatures brought on by NO OZONE PROTECTION DUE TO MANKIND’s CARBON EMISSIONS.
Great economicaly and environmentalaly
about climate change is real
I think all schools across the nation should be use vlean enery in any way possible. I dont care for eind turbines in our oceans . They kill our oceans. But there are other forms of clean energy to be used.
It might save the environment in a fractional way
more funds for educatioal pursuits
Keep kids in school despite heat or cold!
i feel like clean energy would impact everything on earth in a very good way.
good
Healthy environment
make it more expensive. we are already one of the cleanest energy. if it aint broken dont try to charge customers more for something they dont even want. 💯
Everyone should recycle ♻️ to persevere the world...
Save money Improve health
Yes
support
Tremendously for the better
more no electric days for the children!
What kind of dirty energy are the using now? They should be nuclear powered..
They help move us further away from fossil fuels
i feel climate/ clean energy.....and definitely no...no...trymp will affect our schools and life in multiple positive ways.
should not!
cheaper power, cleaner air & improved national security.
Not sure
I think it could save you a lot of money you could put solar panels on top of every school I worked in school districts in Texas. there have been initiatives I just read about them somewhere today on Facebook where they're building battery systems in many communities and at least one of the town's turned it down. but these are major battery systems that can be powered by solar power and you could even incorporate the building of it teaching some of the students how to use the technology. I've worked since at least I lived in Texas and the information technology construction field, and one of the big things down here in like the electrical field is the unions have their own school to teach people how to install solar power I didn't even know about it until I happen to travel to San Antonio one time. that's the only city that has this connection between the electrical training schools and solar power. not even in Austin. so what I'm saying to you is you could have a connection between the building of the electrical systems with solar power etc and help the students to get jobs if they wanted to do that type of construction or technical training. it's the future either way.
Offer cost effective solutions for heating and cooling schools
with healthy results
yes
yes, it will make them more costly to build and operate while doing nothing to improve the kids education or improve the environment.
As a retired teacher its very important,clean energy solutions should impact the schools.
They now use geo.therm and solar and hydro-el.
uyes
it will improve the quality of learning in our students
This could have a positive effect on our state period including our schools.
It would be safer and since there are schools over 100 years old still being used, it should also help with costs.
Some of the Class Room are Hot & Stuffy! It would be Great to Have Air Conditioners & Air Purifiers! The Student/ Teachers would be Way More Comfortable!
Most definately
Extremely
A lot.
Setting standards
Clean energy can allow schools, or any business or individual really, to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, lower their carbon footprint, and most importantly be self-supporting .
Our Childre deseve the best we can give them.
Long term benefits with high upfront costs
The cosr would be less and the extra saving could be put back in curriculums
Its a teachable tooic in addition to making kids live in cleaner environs
Save money. Better air quality in and around schools
They could contribute to better respiratory health for students amd staff.
To give our students the best possible environment to learn in
Very
One less cincern yhst our students aren't being hinderedby sn unclean environment.
In a healing healthy way, kids are the future
Nasty water old buidings thst cod have abestos Shut Columbus city Dchools dwn unhealthy in every way.
It could lower costs, make classrooms more comfortable.
Schools have better results when the students are comfortable.
Not sure
For the better
i agree 100 %
lower carbon footprint
making air cleaner and improving hvac systems
parking lot need to be covered
Address water issues and cirb development. Increase fire fighting equipment and budgets.
more shades
putting up more solar panels and finding more was to lower utility bills
Homeless
go green
I dont know
????
More trees tgat use less water, free solar panels and grants, plus grant incentives for people wanting to be solar installers
Canopy trees
more electric cars. less coal power.
more trees and water serpentine spray water for people work out side better hrs noght time for hand people work.on job in the sun better humane government
breaking NV energy monopoly up.
Lessen use of fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy creation
First, stop raising the price of utilities! We need help not the utility companies. We need to steer away from fossil fuels as they're not good for our environment.
cooling stations for homeless and people walking in the heat due to no vehicle.
solar energy incentives
Make it affordable for everyone to be able to get solar for their homes. If we can pay for other countries to be helped we can help Americans
whatever needs to be done
More green spaces and whater parks
Affordable Utilities, access to solar power for everyone. Protection for homeless and workers that spend time in the heat
HOA in Nevada should allow solar panels and energy efficient measures to be taken by their residents.
Rebate to install solar
make solar panels mandortory on new construction
lower rates for utilities
plant more trees
STOP BUILDING A NEW HOUSE'S.
would like to lower bills or some kind of compensation for seniors
give more trees and plants
I have a wide extensive list of ideas and inolvidable ways to really make a significant difference in our communitys climate. For the start of it, its real simple. Merly Plant and install Botanical Community gardens that feed and supply the locals and itll be self sustainable. Permaculture a practice made public and commercialized to promote sustainability and resilience for all to excel in!
Do not know at this time
Better public transport
Plant more threes that will servive in the dessrt on little to no water and make solar power more accessible
no more casinos add more trees lutilizevolder buildings for housing
Stop building more homes
A way for people thst sre struggling financislly to get immediate help if their air conditioner stops working!
i don't know
Make a skatepark that’s indoors or is outdoors but is covered with shade
As windy as it is in Carson City, we need turbines all around tht valley; for starters. Our capitol city needs to lead the state to sustainable energy.
Lower energy prices. More covered bus sheds and cooling stations area. More trees all around not just higher priced neighborhoods but all over Nevada
Less pavement, more shade from green and architectural solutions
More safety regulations for outside workers,more shade and trees, heat reflective coatins on roofs, help for low income people to pay for electricity to cool home, help to get old window replaces, ( i have one that needs replacing and can’t afford it, and i sure there are more things that can be donne. Lowering carbon emissions is ESSENTIAL!!!!!!
Sustainable practices, better housing and infrastructure
Plant more trees
don't know
Making solar actually affordable with a lot more incentives as well creating real recyclable plastics and end single use plastics and making EV a lot more affordable creating more charging stations
Break times, more water on site, change in start times
I specifically work with people who were incarcerated and I’m the Director of Return Strong and would love to partner with you guys on this work
pray
Upgrades in ways to bring make in more efficient to save energy
Those who work outside in he heat need breaks more often & we all need our water supply protected.
Save Water More Curbs More NLV Jobs
Development of cleaner for transportation and heating/cooking/manufacturing!
Protection for people working outside. More cooling stations.
Lower energy costs for low income families, disabled, veterans, seniors & children with illnesses. Im TIRED OF BEING HOT AND TRYING TO SURVIVE W/a Disability im sick 95% of the time. I NEED AIR. I NEED AIR. I NEED AIR FEELING LIKE I’M GONNA DIE BC I’M HOT ISN’T A GOOD FEELING. Help us NEVADA I KNOW YALL DON’T CARE ABOUT US.
I don't know just something to help the worker's
Live mostly as much as possible.
not work during the hottest part of the day
The concrete and asphalt ate the biggest problem. We need communities that are designed woth cars being the most importand thing- We, ate the most important thing. Not a car. Traditional concrete and asphalt are not the answer.it is responsible fir acting as a radiator for the heat. I KNOW this.
Lower the cost of the Energy bill
More tree planting around the state
bring down energy costs
Whatever effects climate change globally. Study each area for recommendations then tax and fine the heck out of non complisnts.
Free electricity after 5pm, more cooling stations, all bus stops with covers and water misters
Reduce power rates!
lower price on electric
true monthly average billing only
More covered parking, free solar, move to a different state
Water restrictions are killing me and my property. As far as I can tell they are also being mandated very unfairly. (i.e.) number of people living in house. Size of lot...ect. Trying to figure how the unfair tier system works is impossible to figure out. I don't think Henderson or Boulder City is under the same mandate.
Regulations on energy companies !
To many to name on the spot cuz this is a dire and delicate situation
don't know just something
More trees in lowe socioeconómica neighborhoods
More investment and consumer incentives to adopt and use sustainable energy.
Better update electric appliances and afford for all reisident
Exempt Electric bills
Cheaper electricity, more green space
Lower the cost of utilities instead of increasing the cost
My son in law was a solar worker and has had heat exhaustion
have cool off stations for the less fortunate
I feel like all we do is turn our cities into concrete jungles. it's not fair to our state
Extrem cold
Not sure but maybe get rid of the manopuly
Make alternate power affordable
The elderly and the disabled aren't being paid enough, and most of them have to sacrifice to be able to get their medications and food. Most don't have air conditioning or heat during peak times. Nevada power should reduce the cost for Seniors and the disabled. This is during sky rocketing food and gasoline prices. We all need help from somewhere.
build more community places for those that need places to cool off uild more community pools at affortable prices
We need to be real about the pending danger of a climate that is changing. This will not be easy and i hsve no one solution.
Quit building
increase cooling centeters
More water more 🌳 trees , solar .
free or low cost solar.lower electric costs
Stop the Chemtrails!
Plant trees
Bwyter okaces to go thst are akways open in these extra Hot Days & Nights for thise who may not have anywhere to get out of the Heat.
slow the energy drain off to other states
Cooling centers for the homeless, solar panels for houses and businesses.
I don't know
Not really sure
More solar, and, wind energy. The Las Vegas area has a lot of high wind opportunities to store up that energy, as well as, an abundance of sunshine. The wild fired i.mn CA need to stop as well. I dont know what is the cause of them but we need to help them find more non water related fire supressants.
Go Solar and save on having to produce electric energy
More solar power (I have this) and more electric cars (I own a hybrid
Plant more trees that can live in the desert!
Stop the over building in Reno/ Washoe County.
more shade
Put everything that Obama has back in place it's getting colder n colder earlier in the year now

Climate control
We live in a great area! We don’t flood. We’ve had a few snow storms that have been bad, but our area is great! The worse thing we’ve had is heat and humidity! We’ve had a few bad snow storms in 54 years, but not many! Our neighbors who live in the low lying areas have had flooded yards, but never into their homes. They csn also get icy roads when it snows and it’s very cold! We are very lucky! We are very thankful!!

To protect our environment and safety! 💗
Have Dutch civil engineers design a seawall system for Chesapeake Bay!
Storms destroy families, property
Life safety
stay safe. you cannot be replaced, but things can be
It's complex, we need to build in place that are more better to handle extreme conditions. And fireproof building outside and inside. Start with one building at a Time. Start at the places that we know are hot zones. large places where people can go to escape the immediate fire, more study needs to be done on the flooding conditions I believe the concrete construction is ideal for housing including the roofing is possible can handle extreme conditions and can be easier to repair after an extreme weather conditions. To save lives and reduce cost in the long term. Thank you for having this space to communicate with one another !
Flooding and heat!!😩😩😩😩
the air
POLLUTION IN THE AIR, SOIL, FOOD, AND WATER
The climate changes causing no snow in Virginia and we need the snow. protects it from extreme temperatures. This helps prevent the soil from freezing, which locks in gases like carbon and methane. Reflection: Snow reflects more sunlight than open water or bare ground, which helps keep the Earth cooler. Freshwater: Snow acts as a reservoir of freshwater, gradually releasing it during the spring melt. This sustains rivers and ecosystems. Weather patterns: Snow cover affects regional weather patterns. Drinking water: Cleaner snowpack could provide more drinking water. However, climate change is causing snow cover to decrease: Fewer freezing nights: The number of freezing nights has been declining since 1970. More moisture: The atmosphere is holding more moisture, but where that moisture falls.
